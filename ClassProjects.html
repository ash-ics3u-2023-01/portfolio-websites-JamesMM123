<h1>Class Projects</h1>

<h2>History of Computers Presentations</h2>
<p>For the first assignment of the year, the class was given the project on the significant people of the History of computers (HOC). Each group could pick one significant figure but me and my group mates chose James Gosling who was the creator of Java and much more. </p>

<h2>Programming languages of the World</h2>
<p>This assignment was a poster about a selected Programming language. I chose C++ and made an amazing poster with all the valueable information on it, from who created it to its bonuses and negatives. </p>
