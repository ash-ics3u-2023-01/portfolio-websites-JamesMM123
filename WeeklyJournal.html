<h1>Weekly Journal</h1>

<h2>Week #1</h2>
<p>This week we got started with learning the basics of HTML coding and signing onto Replit, Aswell as watching "The Imitation Game" a pretty good movie about how coding won the second world war. We didnt learn much as it was the first week of school so it was mainly introduction.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #2</h2>
<p>This week we got an introduction to typing club and learning basic python coding such as print, input, and variable statements. By the end of the week we were practicing our python skills and by friday we had a quiz on python.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #3</h2>
<p>This week was filled with starting our history of computer science presentations and by friday presentations were just starting to get presented. Besides the presentations at the start of the week we had some replit input lessons.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #4</h2>
<p>This week was all about presenting our presentations on the history of computer science and finishing up some loose ends. For the first three days presentations went on and I presented wednesday on "James Gosling" the creator of Java. The last two days of the week were split into CS Circles IF statments and creating images with python with the truth and reconciliation theme.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #5</h2>
<p>This week was mainly just a quiz on pythion and CS circles on if else or statements in preperation for our next unit. Not much else happened this week as it was all practice but there was some extra presentations and we got a nokia presentation as a co-op or after highschool job, we got some very good informaion about the company and its jobs.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #6</h2>
<p>This week was primarily made up of practice for if statements and learning about how it functions etc... Mid way through the week we did our first CSE day where we set up our folders for the coming 10 weeks of programming in this new course every wednesday.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #7</h2>
<p>This week we spent some time on minecaft education edition and started unit 1 in CMU, which is a drawing with python website. I finished this quick and got to the second unit like some other people in my class. Our second day of CSE was pretty laid back as it was again setting up the Pi for the next days.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #8</h2>
<p>This week we started our computer languages of the world project and me and my partner chose C++, our poster was very fun to make and I believe we did a good job on it. Besides the project we had some IT presentations for jobs and our third day of CSE, which we finally got to some minor coding and some final testing on the Pi's for next week when we finally get to coding the unicorn hat. </p>
<br>
<h2>Week #9</h2>
<p>This week was pretty short in the sense that it was mainly CMU with some light touches on lists and for loops in python but not much was done with that this week.Most importantly it was halloween this week so we made a spooky CMU drawing and I have to say me and my partner did a good job as ours was reactive. We also finally got lighting up the Pi's sadly mine didnt work properly but it was fixed by the end of the day so that next week me nad my partner can finally get to the main coding.</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #10</h2>
<p>This week was quick and easy, mainly focusing on getting the majority of the class onto unit 3 of CMU and some lists and for loops which I already had gotten too at this point, We touched a little on concatenation but it was quick. This was our fifth week of CSE and I finally got my hands onto coding and it felt really good, as I was really quick at picking it up and easily finished the beginner challenges, lighting up my Pi with all different colors and patterns etc...</p>
<br>
<h2>Week #11</h2>
<p>This week was really calm as it was another couple periods for the rest of the class to catch up, I was already ahead so it gave me time to study and do other stuff with replit and CMU. This time on CSE me and my partner got to the intermediate challenges and got to make some really cool moving and blinking images.</p>
