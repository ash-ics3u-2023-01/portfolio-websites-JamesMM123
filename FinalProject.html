<p>The final project of the unit was the RST. The class was tasked with creating a python program of their choice.</p></p>
<p>I chose to do Hangman and chose to give a little computer science spin on it, making all the words related to this course.</p>
<br>
<p>The link below will take you to my RST game, take a try it's pretty fun.</p>
